/*
 * Gravity Forms Design System Bridge
 *
 * Variable overrides are handled in PHP (bridgeInlineStyles) which wraps each
 * --gf-* value with var(--wp--custom--gf-*, <original>). Child themes override
 * any GF variable via theme.json custom settings, e.g.:
 *
 *   { "custom": { "gfColorPrimary": "var:preset|color|purple" } }
 *
 * This CSS handles only what the PHP bridge can't: element-level normalization
 * and editor UI that isn't controlled by the orbitalDefault config flag.
